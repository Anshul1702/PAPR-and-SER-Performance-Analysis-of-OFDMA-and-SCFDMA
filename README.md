# PAPR-and-SER-Performance-Analysis-of-OFDMA-and-SCFDMA
The single carrier multiple access scheme (SC-FDMA) is a novel method of radio transmission currently used in long term evolution (LTE) technology for uplink due to its high spectral efficiency with low bit error rate and lower peak-to-average power-ratio (PAPR) as compared to OFDM technique. Matlab simulation has been carried out to obtain PAPR performance of SC-FDMA and OFDMA techniques with different numbers of subcarriers. Two different approaches of assigning subcarriers have been assumed, distributed FDMA (DFDMA) and localized FDMA (LFDMA). Interleaved FDMA (IFDMA) is a special case of DFDMA where distribution of DFT outputs have been done uniformly with equal distance.. Comparing the forms of SC-FDMA, we find that interleaved (FDMA) has lower PAPR than localised (FDMA). We also discuss the SER (Symbol Error Rate) performance of both LFDMA and IFDMA schemes and find that the SER performance of localised (FDMA) is better than interleaved (IFDMA) technique.
